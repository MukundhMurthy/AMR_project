# Learning the language of rpoB evolution and escape

Extending [Learning the language of viral evolution and escape](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abd7331) to predict multi-drug resistance mutations in bacterial RNA Polymerase B.

Data
Data for pretraining was selected from UniProtKB under the taxonomic label of gammaproteobacteria, as these strains have been the ones most extensively shown to be prone to antibiotic resistance. Protein isoforms are excluded and redundant sequences will be eliminated.

Dependencies
The major Python package requirements and their tested versions are in requirements.txt.

Experiments
Our experiments were run with Python version 3.7 on a gcloud machine with `IMAGE_URI='gcr.io/cloud-ml-public/training/pytorch-gpu.1-6`.
